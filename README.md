# Pykémon

**Pykémon** is a terminal-based game written in Python, inspired by the classic Pokémon games. This project is developed as part of the DD1349 course, with the aim of exploring game development fundamentals and effective collaboration using GitHub.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- ✅ Build a simplified, text-based Pokémon-style game in Python.
- 🧪 Experiment with potential extensions like:
  - A graphical user interface (GUI)
  - Multiplayer support
- 🤝 Learn how to collaborate efficiently using GitHub:
  - Branching workflows
  - Pull requests
  - Issue tracking
  - Continuous integration / deployment (CI/CD)

## 🕹️ Current Features

- None

## 🚧 In Development / Planned Features

- Terminal-based interface
- Basic battle system
- A few sample Pykémon with unique stats and abilities
- Turn-based mechanics
- Additional Pykémon types and evolutions

## 🚀 Possible Future Features

- Player vs Player (PvP) mode
- Graphical User Interface (possibly with `tkinter`, `pygame`, or another library)
- Online multiplayer functionality
- Save/load system for game state

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Git & GitHub for version control and collaboration
- [Optional future tools: `pygame`, `tkinter`, socket programming, etc.]

## 🤝 Collaboration Workflow

This project emphasizes learning and applying collaborative software development practices:

- Use of GitHub Projects and Issues for task management
- Feature branches and pull requests for new functionality
- Code reviews to ensure quality and consistency
- GitHub Actions for automated testing (planned)

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run the project locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/stre4k/pykemon.git
   cd pykemon
   ```
2. Run the server:
   ```bash
   cd src
   python3 server.py
   ```
3. Run the client:
   ```bash
   python3 client.py
   ```
4. Connect to the server and start playing!
   Locally use `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` to connect to the server.
